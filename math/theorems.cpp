Burnside lemma
For a set X, with members x in X, and a group G, with
operations g in G, where g(x): X -> X.
F_g is the set of x which are fixed points of g (ie.
{ x in X / g(x) = x }).
The number of orbits (connected components in the
graph formed by assigning each x a node and
a directed edge between x and g(x) for every g) is
called M.
M = the average of the fixed points of all
g = (|F_g1| + |F_g2| + ... + |F_gn|) / |G|
If x are images and g are simmetries, then M
corresponds to the amount of objects, |G|
corresponds to the amount of simmetries, and F_g
corresponds to the amount of simmetrical images under
the simmetry g.

Rational root theorem
All rational roots of the polynomials with integer coefficients:
a0 * x^0 + a1 * x^1 + a2 * x^2 + ... + an * x^n = 0
If these roots are represented as p / q, with p and q coprime,
- p is an integer factor of a0
- q is an integer factor of an
Note that if a0 = 0, then x = 0 is a root, the polynomial can be divided by x and the theorem
applies once again.

Petersen's theorem
Every cubic and bridgeless graph has a perfect matching.
